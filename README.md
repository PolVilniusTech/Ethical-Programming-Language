# Ethical-Programming-Language

Motivation comes from the Influencer.
The Problem 1: "Does the people not understand each other?";
The Problem 2: "Does the humanity not understand each other?";
The Problem 3: "Does a machine/computer/robot not understand each other?".
In the Conclusion 
Does all of these Problems can't be fused/joint/unified into a single one Problem, which are relevant for everyone.
Three Problems and Three Samples given.

#### [Official Perl Programming Language](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlsyn)

##### In the Section of a "DESCRIPTION" states following "<...> Perl borrows syntax and concepts from many languages: awk, sed, C, Bourne Shell, Smalltalk, Lisp and even English. <...>"

How come actual English language could be linked to the Set of Programming Languages? 
It takes the Idea, that a person wants to write Manual Pages in English, which would be taken by the "machine" and later on used for some kind Learning, 
i.e. for App creation.
Remarks. Does nowadays we already have too many of those Apps anyway?

#### [Official Perl Programming Language](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlsyn)

##### In the Section of a "Declarations" states following "<...> $me = myname $0             or die "can't get myname"; <...>"

According previous statement "Perl borrows syntax and concepts from <...> even English.". 
Test Case: looking between pre-processors like PHP and Python and aligning used "Dictionary" and "meaning". The terminology could have KNOW-HOW information, that are similar and different between those pre-processors.
Jargon from non-intelectual Side does not show Side of the Expert and could not be taken for Proffesional Language. Who would use such Programming Language, which does not have at least "Code of Ethics". Does even would it be rewised after period of time at least even slightly.

##### In the Section of a "Statement Modifiers" states following "<...> unless is the opposite, it executes the statement unless the condition is true (that is, if the condition is false). <...>"

The Thing from Influencers language that sound like, i.e. You do the party unless You can't get any participant who would come.
From the English statement perspective it looks like the Sentence are very unclear. 
From programming perspective: does every time when the ELSE Statement are launched (if-else statement) would be the same functionality when UNLESS condition would be true?
